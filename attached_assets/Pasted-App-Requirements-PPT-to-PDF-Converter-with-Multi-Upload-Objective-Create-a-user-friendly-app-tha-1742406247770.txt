App Requirements: PPT to PDF Converter with Multi-Upload
Objective : Create a user-friendly app that converts multiple PowerPoint files (PPT/PPTX) to PDFs in batch mode.

Core Features
Multi-File Upload
Allow users to upload multiple PPT/PPTX files via:
Drag-and-drop interface.
File picker (select multiple files at once).
Display a list of uploaded files with thumbnails/previews.
Batch Conversion
Convert all uploaded files to PDFs in a single operation.
Preserve original formatting, images, and embedded elements.
Support for password-protected PPT files (optional).
Progress Tracking
Show real-time progress bars for each file conversion.
Notify users upon completion (e.g., toast alerts or banners).
Download Options
Download individual PDFs or a ZIP bundle of all converted files.
Option to delete files from the server post-download.
Security & Privacy
Automatically delete uploaded files and PDFs after 24 hours.
Scan files for malware (integrate tools like ClamAV).
HTTPS encryption for data in transit.
Technical Stack
Frontend :

Framework: React.js or Vue.js for dynamic UI.
Drag-and-drop: Use react-dropzone or vue-dropzone.
Progress display: Axios interceptors or WebSocket for real-time updates.
Backend :

Language: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express/NestJS).
Conversion Tools:
Option 1 : LibreOffice CLI (soffice --headless) for cross-platform conversion.
Option 2 : Aspose.Slides API (paid, but robust).
Option 3 : Python python-pptx + pdfkit (for basic conversions).
File Handling: Process files in a queue (e.g., Celery/RabbitMQ for Python).
Deployment :

Cloud: AWS, DigitalOcean, or Vercel (frontend) + Heroku/Render (backend).
Containerization: Docker for scalability.
UI/UX Design
Homepage :
Hero section with "Upload PPT/PPTX" button and drag-and-drop zone.
Clear instructions (e.g., "Drop files here or click to upload").
Processing Page :
Table/list view of files with status (queued, converting, completed).
Cancel button for individual files.
Download Page :
Summary of converted files with download buttons.
"Download All" ZIP option.
Edge Cases
Handle corrupted PPT files (graceful error messages).
Large file support (e.g., 500MB+ files; implement chunked uploads).
Rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 10 files per hour for free users).
Example Workflow
User uploads 5 PPT files via drag-and-drop.
Backend queues files, converts them sequentially, and streams progress to frontend.
On completion, user downloads a ZIP of PDFs or saves files to cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).
Deliverables :

MVP: Basic conversion with multi-upload and ZIP download.
Stretch Goals:
OCR for scanned PPTs.
PDF customization (e.g., page size, quality).
API access for developers.
